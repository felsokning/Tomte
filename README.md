# Tomte
A combination of Windows PowerShell, WCF Client, Windows Service, WCF Service, and Windows Workflow Foundation (a.k.a.: Code Activities) to automate actions on remote windows machines.

Tomte is named after the [nisse/tomte of Scaninavian folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisse_(folklore)#Ancestor_spirit) and the general idea is much the same: If Tomte is treated well,  it will aid in the chores and work.
